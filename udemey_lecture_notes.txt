Accounts - files stored on blockchain that allow us to store data on them


We need to create an account in the wallet. One account would hold specific token and allow us to transact specific token

A wallet can have multiple accounts. 


spl-token create-account TOKEN_ADDRESS --url devnet

Check Number of tokens that are in the specific account 
spl-token balance TOKEN_ADDRESS --url devnet


Minting - Process of making tokens 

spl-token mint TOKEN_ADDRESS NUMBER_OF_TOKENS --url devnet

Token balance means tokens minted

circulating supply - total number of solana tokens used by users 

Checking supply
spl-token supply TOKEN_ADDRESS --url devnet

Disable token minting
spl-token  authorize TOKEN_ADDRESS mint —disable --url devnet

Burn Tokens  that you own ( you can only burn those tokens that you own not ones other own)
spl-token  burn ACCOUNT_ADDRESS NUMBER_OF_TOKENS --url devnet


Transfer: spl-token transfer TOKEN_ADDRESS TOKEN_AMOUNT WALLET_ADDRESS --url devnet —unfunded 




Solana Programs - Used to write lines of code
stateless 

To store data on solana : Accounts
 
IDL - Interface description Language
contains information from program that is useful in testing and integrating program with frontend


Context - list of accounts that a solana program needs to run successfully
it consists of solana accounts ( in order to retrieve data )

We put data into accounts using solana program. Then retrieve data by using contexts


ts-node /Users/tk-lpt-592/Desktop/workspace/anchor/metaplex/metaplex/js/packages/cli/src/candy-machine-v2-cli.ts  upload -e devnet -k ~/.config/solana/devnet.json -cp config.json ./assets

ts-node /Users/tk-lpt-592/Desktop/workspace/anchor/metaplex/metaplex/js/packages/cli/src/candy-machine-v2-cli.ts verify_upload -e devnet -k ~/.config/solana/devnet.json









Sign nft collection with solana wallet
Sell -  Transfer nft to the buyer’s wallet.


standardized tools to create and upload nft
Metaplex - used to create, upload and mint nft

Metaplex Candy Machine - Allows minting random nft




ts-node /Users/tk-lpt-592/Desktop/workspace/anchor/metaplex/metaplex/js/packages/cli/src/candy-machine-v2-cli.ts  --version




Dapp means server is replaced by solana program and database is replaced by account


System Program - 
1. Creates accounts in solana
2. Allocates account data
3. assign accounts to owning programs
4. Transfer lamports
5. Pay transaction fee




Program id: specifies how to load and execute this program. also contains info about how solana runtime should treat this program.
helps see all accounts created and reference them.


To deploy program:
change localnet to devnet in toml file
build:
	anchor build
get program id:
	solana address -k config file path
replace output program id with dummy one in lib.rs
build again:
	anchor build
deploy:
	anchor deploy




Programs can be updated and refreshed and program id won’t be change
Eth smart contracts cannot be changed.



opts.preflightCommitment in creating provider:
it tells us how much  to wait . whether for deploying it to one computer or to deploying it to all computers ( Blockchain )


import { SystemProgram, Keypair} = web3; // System Porgram references to core program that runs solana


Chainlink

Allows us to use up to date real time data e.g live crypto prices
Node operators put data on chainlink and locks some money. if data put is good they receive reward and if data is bad they loose their locked amount 

Chainlink Program -  Solana Program created by chainlink
Chainlink Feed - Data feed

Latest Round -> means retrieving latest data from the feed


We have to provide signers if we are creating a new account


Program Derived Address
Accounts that can only be modified by the program

Accounts that can send and receive money.
Backbone of Solana DeFi



Account Rent
When an account is created, it needs to store some SOL as rent in order to maintain its existence. After some time, some SOL would be deducted from that account as rent otherwise that account won’t exist.
Rent Exemption 
If 2 years worth of rent is stored in account. Then, rent won’t be collected.
